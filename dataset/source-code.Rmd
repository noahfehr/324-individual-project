We've got our data in. Now, we want to manipulate these to end up with two tables. One table with country and total energy consumption; the other with country and renewable energy production
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
renewablebycountry <- read.csv("countrygeneration.csv")
consumptionbycountry <-read.csv("countryconsumption.csv")

# This next block of code is focusing on areas of interest (country and total renewable energy produced)
renewablebycountry <- rename(renewablebycountry, "total" = "Total..TWh.")
renewablebycountry <- select(renewablebycountry, c("Country", "total"))

# the renewablecountry data is from 2017, so we'll just focus on consumption from 2017
consumptionbycountry <- filter(consumptionbycountry, Year == 2017)
# now we want to configure a table based on this data to match the specifications described above
Country <- colnames(consumptionbycountry) [-1]
Consumption <- as.numeric(consumptionbycountry) [-1]
consumptionbycountry <- data.frame(Country, Consumption)

# now we want to merge these together into one table by country
CountryRel <- merge (consumptionbycountry, renewablebycountry, by="Country")
ggplot(CountryRel, aes(x=Consumption, y=total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(label=CountryRel$Country)
CountryRel
```

```{r}
#renewable by energy should only have country and Total.TWh
#renaming for clarity

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
